## Vision Transformer for Object Detection

This repository contains an implementation of the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture for object detection. The model is designed to detect objects in images and predict their 
bounding boxes and classes. The ViT architecture, originally proposed for image classification, is adapted here for object detection tasks.
